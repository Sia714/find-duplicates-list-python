# find-duplicates-list-python
The code snippet provided below showcases two effective approaches to detect and enumerate the duplicate elements in a user-defined list using the Python programming language. The shorter method leverages the Counter class from the built-in collections module to efficiently tally the frequency of each item in the input list and identify the ones that appear more than once. The long technique involves using a nested loop to compare each element of the list with the ones that come after it and increment a counter variable whenever a match is found, thus allowing us to compute the total number of duplicates.
