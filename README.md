# find-duplicates-list-python
The code snippet provided below showcases two effective approaches to detect and enumerate the duplicate elements in a user-defined list using the Python programming language.  The shorter approach relies on utilizing a dictionary to efficiently tally the frequency of each element and identify the ones that occur more than once. This method employs the built-in function "Counter" to facilitate the counting process, which results in a concise and readable solution. In contrast, the long technique using multiple lists to store the indexes and values of the duplicates. As this method does not employ a dictionary, it is much more complex than the first one and may be less efficient for larger datasets. However, it can be useful in scenarios where external libraries or modules are not available, or where more fine-grained control over the detection process is desired.
